## Namitha Hanumantharaya

I am an ambitious person with a passion for code and problem solving. I just completed a 3 month intensive web development course at Makers Academy Remote, where I developed my ability to pick up new skills, learn and produce content at a very fast-pace, whilst having a young child to look after. I am looking for a junior developer job where I can utilise my skills and carry on learning.

## Skills

#### Fast Learner

Constantly looking for ways to improve in everything I do. Love a challenge and tackling things I have had no prior experience with.

- Built multiple projects in various different languages throughout the Makers Academy course
- Learnt ES6 and Phaser and built a 2D game in 12 days https://makers-invaders.herokuapp.com/

#### Problem Solving

Ability to breakdown large problems into smaller components. Previous work required fast and accurate decision making to help solve problems.
