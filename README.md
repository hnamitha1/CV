## Namitha Hanumantharaya

I am an Application Developer at heart. Due to family commiments I've taken a break from employment, however I have continued to learn
with online courses throughout that time. I have recently graduated from [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), a highly selective web developer bootcamp. At Makers I have learnt new skills at fast pace, worked in teams under an Agile methodology, and produce some exciting products. I am looking for a junior web developer job where I can apply and develop my skills.

## Skills

#### Enthusiastic Learner

I am constantly looking for ways to improve in everything I do. I love a challenge and I am comfortable tackling new techniques, some experiences I have had in Makers as well as previous jobs are...

- Built multiple projects in various different languages throughout the Makers Academy course using TDD
- At Makers Academy I worked in a team of four, we thought ourselves ES6 and Phaser with the rewarding result of a 2D game [Makers Invaders](https://makers-invaders.herokuapp.com/) built in 12 days, using Agile methodology.

#### Problem Solving

- Ability to breakdown large problems into smaller components. I spent a lot of time at Makers Academy learning better ways to solve programming problems and debug errors by breaking down a problem to identify the key issue, then hypothesising about the root cause of this and methodically investigating to eliminate options and solve the problem. 
- Previous work required fast and accurate decision making to help solve problems. I applied problem solving techniques to find efficient and effective solutions to these problems, and identify which issues would need to be escalated. By solving problems I was able to build strong relationships with my colleagues.
- Pair programmed daily at Makers Academy to solve coding problems and teach each other the curriculum
