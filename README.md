## Namitha Hanumantharaya

I am an Application Developer at heart. Before learning to code I did a technical degree including modules such as Information & Communication System Engineering. I also worked at IBM as an Application Developer, becoming fully familiar with the software development cycle.

Due to family commitments I then took a break from work for a couple of years but I continued to learn with online courses throughout that time.

I have recently graduated from [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), a highly selective web developer bootcamp. At Makers I have learnt new skills at fast pace, worked in teams under an Agile methodology, and produce some exciting products. I am looking for a junior web developer job where I can apply and develop my skills.

## Skills

#### Enthusiastic Learner

I am constantly looking for ways to improve in everything I do. I love a challenge and I am comfortable tackling new techniques, some experiences I have had in Makers as well as previous jobs are...

- Built multiple projects in various languages throughout the Makers Academy course using TDD.
- At Makers Academy I worked in a team of four, we taught ourselves ES6 and Phaser with the rewarding result of a 2D game [Makers Invaders](https://makers-invaders.herokuapp.com/) built in 12 days, using Agile methodology.
- At my previous work, the entire application was developed using the language Pro *C (embedded SQL programming language used by Oracle Database management systems). I learnt  Pro *C in 3 weeks. In 3 weeks my knowledge of Pro *C was enough to effectively contribute to the project. 

#### Problem Solving

- Ability to breakdown large problems into smaller components. I spent a lot of time at Makers Academy learning better ways to solve programming problems and debug errors by breaking down a problem to identify the key issue, then hypothesising about the root cause of this and methodically investigating to eliminate options and solve the problem. 
- Previous work required fast and accurate decision making to help solve problems. I applied problem solving techniques to find efficient and effective solutions to these problems, and identify which issues would need to be escalated. By following these techniques I was able to build strong relationships with my colleagues.
 
#### Team player

- Pair programmed daily at Makers Academy to solve coding problems and teach each other the curriculum.
- I've shown myself to be extremely adaptable to the needs of the other members, able to give positive feedback and to help solve all kinds of problems.
