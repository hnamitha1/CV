## Namitha Hanumantharaya

I am a former Application Developer and have been a homemaker for the past four years whilst continuing to extend my knowledge with several online courses throughout that time. I have recently graduated from the extremely intense Makers Academy Remote coding bootcamp where I developed the ability to pick up new skills, learn and produce content at a very fast-pace, whilst having a young child to look after. I am looking for a junior web developer job where I can utilise my skills and carry on learning.

## Skills

#### Fast Learner

I am constantly looking for ways to improve in everything I do. I love a challenge and am comfortable tackling new techniques that I have no prior experience with.

- Built multiple projects in various different languages throughout the Makers Academy course using TDD
- At Makers Academy I worked in a team with four other students Learnt ES6 and Phaser that we have not learnt before and built a 2D game in 12 days https://makers-invaders.herokuapp.com/, using Agile methodology. 

#### Problem Solving

- Ability to breakdown large problems into smaller components. I spent a lot of Makers Academy learning better ways to solve programming problems and debug errors by breaking down a problem to identify the key issue, then hypothesising about the root cause of this and methodically investigating to eliminate options and solve the problem. 
- Previous work required fast and accurate decision making to help solve problems. I applied problem solving techniques to find efficient and effective solutions to these problems, and identify which issues would need to be escalated. By solving problems I was able to build strong relationships with my colleagues.
- Pair programmed daily at Makers Academy to solve coding problems and teach each other the curriculum
